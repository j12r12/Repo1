# Repo1

To move towards a career in Data Analysis / Data Science I have created this repository showing a number of small programmes I have created for use in my day to day work.

I do not currently work in the Data Science field, however I have been able to use python programming in my job to automate a lot of onerous manual tasks and to develop and automate reports and analyses.

# Project 1 - Basic Data Analysis Project

As part of a job as a Bid Manager, I am required to provide a price for which my company could provide the works required by our clients. 

For one bid in particular we were given some nice data on all jobs undertaken over the previous 12 months, which included columns such as Job Site Location, Type of Job and a very useful Date/Time Received column. 

I used this data to produce a set of useful and attractive visualisations to allow the Operations Team to make an informed decision on the final pricing of the bid.

I love using data to show real world trends and while the techniques used in this programme were quite simple, they produced great results that were actually very useful to the decision makers in the company.
